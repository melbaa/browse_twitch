# Why
The program can be used to quickly find new games or old games you missed that
people still enjoy. It's also useful to confirm that there are close to 0
games that you still enjoy and it's time to move to a new hobby.

# Install
* get python 3
* pip install requests

# Usage
Add games you are not interested in to ignore_games.txt. Case, duplicates
and order don't matter. You can sort with sort_games.py if you want to.
